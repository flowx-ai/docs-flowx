With the FLOWX Designer, you can:

* Develop [**processes**](../terms/flowx-process) based on [BPMN 2.0](../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-bpmn)
* Configure interfaces for the processes for both generated and custom screens
* Define [**business rules**](../terms/business-rules) and validations via [DMN](../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-dmn.md) files or via [MVEL](../platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/business-process-industry-standards/intro-to-mvel.md), or using other supported scripting languages
* Create integration connectors in a visual manner
* Create [**data models**](../terms/flowx-data-model) for your applications
* Adding new capabilities by using [plugins](../platform-deep-dive/plugins/plugins.md)
