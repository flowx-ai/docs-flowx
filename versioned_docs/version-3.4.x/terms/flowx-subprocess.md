A subprocess is a smaller process flow that can be triggered by actions in the main process. Subprocesses can be started asynchronously or synchronously, and they can inherit some process parameter values from the parent process. They can communicate with front-end apps using the same connection details as their parent process. Subprocesses can be configured and started using the FLOWX Designer, either by using a StartSubprocess action inside a task node or by adding a custom Subprocess Run node type.
