The process designer is a component of FLOWX.AI Designer that allows users to visually design and define business processes. It is a no-code development environment where users can create and manage the steps and actions involved in a business process. The process designer uses the BPMN 2.0 standard, making it easy for business analysts and product managers to quickly understand and create new applications or add new functionality. It provides a visual representation of the process flow and allows users to configure interfaces, define business rules, create integration connectors, and manage user access.
