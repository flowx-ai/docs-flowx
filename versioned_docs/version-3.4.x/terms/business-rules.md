Business rules are a way to define and enforce specific behaviors or conditions within a business process. They are used to automate decision-making and guide the flow of a process based on certain criteria. Business rules can be attached to specific nodes or actions within a process, and they can be written in various scripting languages such as MVEL, JavaScript, Python, Groovy, or DMN (Decision Model and Notation). These rules can read and manipulate data within the process and can be used to make decisions, perform calculations, or trigger specific actions. Business rules are a powerful tool for creating flexible and adaptable processes that can respond to changing conditions or requirements.
