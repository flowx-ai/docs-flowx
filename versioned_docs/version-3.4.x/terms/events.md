In an event-driven platform, events are the central focus, and the system reacts to events by triggering appropriate actions or workflows. Events can be any occurrence or change in the system, such as user actions, messages from external systems.

Events can be generated by various sources, such as user interactions, system events, external APIs, or other applications. FLOWX captures these events and uses them to initiate the execution of predefined processes or actions.
By leveraging events, FLOWX enables real-time processing and automation of business processes. It allows for seamless integration with external systems and provides a flexible and scalable approach to building applications.
