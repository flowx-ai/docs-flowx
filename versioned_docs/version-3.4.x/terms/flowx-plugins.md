Plugins are pre-built pieces of functionality that can be added to the FLOWX.AI platform to expand its capabilities. Plugins allow users to add features such as document management, sending notifications, OCR (Optical Character Recognition), task management, customer management, and reporting to their FLOWX.AI deployment. Each plugin is a microservice app that can connect to the core platform using Kafka events.
