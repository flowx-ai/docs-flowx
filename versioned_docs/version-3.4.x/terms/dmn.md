DMN stands for Decision Model and Notation. It is a graphical language used to specify business decisions. DMN helps convert complex decision-making code into easily readable diagrams. It complements the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) by providing a mechanism for modeling decision-making within a process model. DMN can be used independently or in conjunction with BPMN.
