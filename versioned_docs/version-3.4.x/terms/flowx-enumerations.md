Enumerations are a way to create collections of values that can be used as content in UI components or templates. They allow you to define a set of values for specific source systems or languages. Enumerations can be organized hierarchically, with the ability to create child collections. They are used to provide options for selection in user interfaces and can be imported or exported in formats such as JSON or CSV.
