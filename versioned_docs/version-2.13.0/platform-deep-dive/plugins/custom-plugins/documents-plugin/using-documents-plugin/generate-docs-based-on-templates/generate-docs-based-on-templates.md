# Generating docs based on templates

One of the main features of the document management plugin is the ability to generate new documents based on custom templates and prefilled with data related to the current process instance. These templates can be easily configured using the [**What you see is what you get** (WYSIWYG)](../../../../wysiwyg.md) editor. You can create/manage your templates by accessing the **Document templates** section in FLOWX.AI Designer.

[WYSIWYG](../../../../wysiwyg.md)

[Managing HTML templates](managing-html-templates.md)

[Generating from HTML templates](generating-from-html-templates.md)
