# Creating a new process definition

The first step of defining your business process in the FLOWX Designer is adding a new [process definition](../../building-blocks/process/process-definition/process-definition.md) for it.

This should include at least one [START](../../building-blocks/node/start-end-node.md#start-node) and [END](../../building-blocks/node/start-end-node.md#end-node) node.

### Steps for creating a new process definition

To create a new process definition:

1. Open **FLOWX Designer** and go to the **Definitions** tab.
2. Click the **New process** button, using the **breadcrumbs** from the top-right corner.
3. Enter a unique name for your process and click **Create**.
4. You're automatically taken to the **FLOWX Designer** editor where you can start building your process.
