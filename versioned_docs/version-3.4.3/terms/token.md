A token is a concept in the BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) framework that represents the current position or state within a process instance. It keeps track of the progress of the process flow and stores data related to the current state of the process instance. When a process instance is started, a token is created. As actions are executed in the process, the token moves from one node to the next. It also keeps track of the actions executed in each node.
