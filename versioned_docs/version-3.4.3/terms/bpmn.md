BPMN stands for Business Process Model and Notation. It is a graphical representation used to specify business processes in a business process model. BPMN is the most widely used standard for business process diagrams and is intended to be used by stakeholders who design, manage, and realize business processes. It allows for precise modeling of process flows and can be translated into software process components. BPMN uses a set of process elements (nodes) connected by sequences to represent a business process flow.
