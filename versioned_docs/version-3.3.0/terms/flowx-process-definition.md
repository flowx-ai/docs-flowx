The process definition is the blueprint or template of a business process in the FLOWX platform. It represents a series of steps that need to be followed in order to achieve a desired outcome or objective. A process definition is created in the FLOWX Designer and serves as a guide for executing, monitoring, and optimizing the business process. Each time the process needs to be used, a new instance of the process definition is started. Think of the process definition as a blueprint for a house, and the process instance as each house of that type being built.
