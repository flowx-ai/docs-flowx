Microservices are a software development approach where applications are built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other through well-defined APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Each microservice is designed to perform a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of other services.

Deploying microservices typically involves breaking down the application into smaller, modular components. Each microservice should be independently deployable, with all the necessary dependencies and configurations included.

Once the microservices have been created, they can be deployed using a container management system such as Docker or Kubernetes. These systems allow for the deployment of multiple microservices in a single environment.
