Actions in the FLOWX.AI platform are used to define the activity that a node has to handle. They can have various types and are used to specify the communication details for plugins or integrations. Actions can include business rules in a process and send various data to be displayed in front-end applications. Actions can be manual or automatic, and they can be set as optional or mandatory. If all mandatory actions are not performed on a process node, the flow will not advance. Actions can also be marked as one-time or repeatable. They can be linked together to run immediately after another action is performed.
