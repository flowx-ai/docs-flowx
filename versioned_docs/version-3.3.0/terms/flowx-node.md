Nodes are visual representations of points in a process. They are used to mark the entrance of a record into the process and represent different steps or actions within the process flow. Nodes can be added at specific process points to define the flow of the process. There are different types of nodes, such as start and end nodes, task nodes, user task nodes, send message tasks, receive message tasks, exclusive and parallel gateways, milestones, and subprocess run nodes.
