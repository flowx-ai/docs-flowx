# Form elements

Form elements are a crucial aspect of creating user interfaces as they serve as the means of collecting information from the users. These elements come in various types, including simple forms, [inputs](input-form-field.md), [text areas](input-form-field.md), drop-down menus ([select](select-form-field.md)), [checkboxes](checkbox-form-field.md), [radio buttons](radio-form-field.md), toggle switches ([switch](switch-form-field.md)), and [date pickers](datepicker-form-field.md). Each of these form elements serves a unique purpose and offers different options for capturing user input.
