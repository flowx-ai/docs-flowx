A checkbox is a form element that allows users to select one or more options from the given options.

The available configuration options for this form element are:

#### Checkbox settings

1. **General**
   * **Key** - creates the biding between form element and process data, so it can be later used in [decisions](../../../node/exclusive-gateway-node.md), [business rules](../../../node/task-node/task-node.md) or [integrations](../../../node/message-send-received-task-node.md)
2. **Validators** - multiple validators can be added to a select (more details [here](../../validators.md))
3. **Data source**
   * **Default Value** - the default value of the checkbox
   * **Source Type** - it can be Static, Enumeration, or Process Data
4. **Expressions**
   * **Hide** - JavaScript expressions used to hide components when they're truthy
   * **Disabled expressions** - JavaScript expressions that should be evaluated as true or false. It's important to make sure that disabled fields have the same expression configured under the path **expressions â†’ hide**

#### Checkbox styling

* valid CSS properties (more details [here](../../#styling))

A checkbox with three options and a column layout will look like this.
