# Process definition

At the core of the platform are the process definitions. These are the blueprint of the business process, made up of [nodes](broken-reference) that are linked by sequences.

While designing the FLOWX.AI components, we've tried to keep them as close to their BPMN counterparts as possible:

[node](node/)


Once a process is defined and set as published on the platform, it can be executed, monitored, and optimized. When a business process is started, a new instance of the definition is created.
