## Types of UI areas

You can create the following types of navigation areas:

* **Stepper**: A stepper guides users through a sequence of logical and numbered steps, aiding in navigation.
* **Page**: This type displays basic full-page content for an immersive user experience.
* **Modal**: A modal temporarily takes control of the user's interaction within a process as an overlay, requiring user interaction before returning to the main application or website functionality.

### Stepper

A stepper breaks down progress into logical and numbered steps, making navigation intuitive.

### Steps

Steps are individual elements within a stepper, simplifying complex processes.

### Page

Use this UI configuration to display comprehensive full-page content.

### Modal

Modals provide temporary control over user interaction within a process, often as pop-ups or overlays, guiding users through a specific task before returning to the main application or website functionality.
