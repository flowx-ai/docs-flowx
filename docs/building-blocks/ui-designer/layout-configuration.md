# Layout configuration

Layout settings will be available for all components that can group other types of elements (for example, [Container](./ui-component-types/root-components/container.md) or [Card](./ui-component-types/root-components/card.md)).

These settings allow users to customize properties as the layout direction, alignment, gap, sizing, and spacing.
