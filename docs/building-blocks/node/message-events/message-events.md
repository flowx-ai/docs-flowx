# Message events

Message events serve as a means to incorporate messaging capabilities into business process modeling. These events are specifically designed to capture the interaction between different process participants by referencing messages. By leveraging message events, processes can pause their execution until the expected messages are received, enabling effective coordination and communication between various system components.
