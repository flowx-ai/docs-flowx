# Languages

The FLOWX Headless CMS can store and manage languages. You can add a language and use it in almost any content management configuration.

On the main screen inside **Languages**, you have the following elements:

* **Code** - not displayed in the end-user interface, but used to assure value uniqueness
* **Name** - the name of the language
* **Default** - you can set a language as **Default** (default values can't be deleted)
