# Plugins

Adding new capabilities to the core platform can be easily done by using plugins. FLOWX Plugins represent already built functionality that can be added to a FLOWX platform deployment.
These could be either one of the provided custom plugins that we've already built or by building your own.
On our roadmap, weâ€™re also looking to enhance the plugins library with 3rd party providers, so stay tuned for more.
