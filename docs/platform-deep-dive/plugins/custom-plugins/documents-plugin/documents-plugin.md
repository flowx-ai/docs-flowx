# ðŸ“¦ Documents plugin

The document plugin can be easily added to your custom FLOWX.AI deployment to **enhance the core platform capabilities with functionality specific to document handling**.

The plugin offers the possibility to:

* store and make changes to documents
* generate documents based on predefined templates and custom process related data
* create various templates using the [WYSIWYG](../../wysiwyg.md) editor

* import already created templates

* convert documents from PDF to JPEG 
* splitting bulk documents into smaller separate documents
* editing documents to add generated barcodes/signatures and assets

It can be quickly deployed on the chosen infrastructure, preloaded with the needed industry-specific document templates using an intuitive WYSIWYG editor, and then connected to the FLOWX.AI Engine through Kafka events.

It can be easily used and integrated into your business [processes definitions](../../../../building-blocks/process/process-definition/process-definition.md) by using Kafka send/receive event nodes.
