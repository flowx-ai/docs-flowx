# ðŸ“¦ Documents plugin

The documents plugin can be easily added to your custom FLOWX deployment to **enhance the core platform capabilities with functionality specific to document handling**.

The plugin offers the possibility to:

* store and make changes to documents
* generate documents based on predefined templates (docx or HTML) and custom process related data
* convert documents between various formats
* splitting bulk documents into smaller separate documents
* editing documents to add generated barcodes/signatures and pictures

It can be quickly deployed on the chosen infrastructure, preloaded with the needed industry-specific document templates using a REST interface and then connected to the FLOWX Engine through Kafka events.

Let's go through the steps needed in order to deploy and set up the plugin:
