# Exporting / importing a process definition version

To copy [**process definitions**](../../terms/flowx-process-definition) and move them between different environments, you can use the export/import feature.

## Export a process definition version

You can export a process definition version as a JSON file directly from the process definition versions list in the [**FLOWX Designer**](../../terms/flowx-ai-designer):

## Import a process definition

You can then import the process definition from the FLOWX Designer.

When you press "Import Process" button from the process designer, by accessing the breadcrumbs menu. Then the system will open a local file browser displaying available JSON files.

:::caution
Previously published versions (can no longer be used). Only Latest WIP versions.

:::caution
In case a version was exported using an incompatible FLOWX Designer version, you will receive an error and not be able to import it. It will first need to be adjusted to match the format needed by your current FLOWX Designer version.
