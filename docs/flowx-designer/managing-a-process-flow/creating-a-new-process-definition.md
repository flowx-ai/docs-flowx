# Creating a new process definition

In the [**FLOWX Designer**](../../terms/flowx-ai-designer), the first step in defining your business process is to create a new [process definition](../../building-blocks/process/process-definition.md).

This definition should include at least one [START](../../building-blocks/node/start-end-node.md#start-node) node and one [END](../../building-blocks/node/start-end-node.md#end-node) node.

## Steps for creating a new process definition

Follow these steps to create a new [**process definition**](../../terms/flowx-process-definition):

1. Launch [**FLOWX Designer**](../../terms/flowx-ai-designer) and navigate to the **Definitions** tab.
2. Click the **New Process** button, accessible from the top-right corner using the **breadcrumbs**.
3. Provide a unique name for your process, then click **Create**.
4. You'll be automatically directed to the **FLOWX Designer** editor, where you can begin building your first process version.
5. Submit changes to your version.
