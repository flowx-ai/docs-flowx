# Designing a process flow

Having explored the fundamental components and building blocks of the [**FLOWX Platform**](../../terms/flowx), let's delve into the steps necessary to create a new [**process flow**](../../terms/flowx-process) using the intuitive [**FLOWX Designer**](../../terms/flowx-process-designer). üßó‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Explore the following topics to guide you through the process:

[Creating a new Process Definition](creating-a-new-process-definition)

[Adding a New Node](adding-a-new-node)

[Incorporating Actions into Nodes](adding-an-action-to-a-node)

[Handling Decisions Within the Flow](handling-decisions-in-the-flow)

[Expanding Flow Branches](adding-more-flow-branches)

[Creating a User Interface](creating-a-user-interface)

[Moving a token backwards](moving-a-token-backwards-in-a-process)

[Exporting/importing a process definition version](creating-a-new-process-definition.md)

[Starting processes](starting-a-process)

By following these steps, you will gain the ability to construct end-to-end process flows and become proficient in using FLOWX Designer. :pencil2:
