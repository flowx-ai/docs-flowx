No-code/full-code refers to the capabilities of a platform or development environment. No-code means that users can create applications or software without having to write any code. They can use visual interfaces, drag-and-drop tools, and pre-built components to design and configure their applications. This allows people without advanced programming skills, such as business analysts or product managers, to develop applications. Full-code, on the other hand, means that users have the option to write custom code to customize or extend the functionality of their applications. This is typically used by experienced developers who have programming skills and want more flexibility and control over the application's behavior.
