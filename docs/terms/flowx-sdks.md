FLOWX.AI provides web and native mobile SDKs. These SDKs enable developers to create applications that can be displayed in a browser, embedded in an internet banking interface, or in a mobile banking app. The SDKs automatically generate the user interface (UI) based on the business process and data points created by a business analyst, reducing the need for UX/UI expertise.
