Howdy :wave:. Did you miss us? Here is what we prepared for you on our latest release:

## **New features**

### FLOWX.AI Designer üë©‚Äçüè≠

#### Data model

Data model tab is now live. You can now go through the business data model and access the predefined data model whenever you need to write an attribute‚Äôs path.

* Supported attributes type: `STRING`, `NUMBER`, `BOOLEAN`, `OBJECT`, `ARRAY`, `ENUM`


[Data model](/docs/building-blocks/process/process-definition#data-model)

#### Process designer navigation redesign

A new polished UI navigation is available (left-side navigation panel), improving the overall user experience when working with FLOWX.AI Designer:

* new **Process Designer** tab
* new **UI Designer** tab 
* new **History** tab
* new **Data model** tab
* **Settings** menu moved in the left-side navigation panel

#### Exceptions on processes

* added new exceptions types

### UI Designer ‚úèÔ∏è

#### Data model 

You can now add data model keys directly from the UI Designer. The already-defined keys in the **Data model** are also displayed (using the auto-suggestion tool).

[UI Designer](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer)

### Reporting plugin 

Added the possibility to create and bootstrap custom reports built on generic information about usage and processes using the new reporting plugin. 

You can create multiple reports to meet any need when it comes to business flows. It enables users to analyze data using datasets, and to easily build charts and dashboards.

#### Use in reporting flag

This flag is available inside **Data model** (for the keys that must be used in the reporting) and inside **Process settings** tab, to include a process definition in reporting.

### FLOWX.AI Engine üöÇ

#### NEW: process instance indexing through Kafka transport

Sending data through Kafka : Instead of sending data directly from the process engine to ElasticSearch(ES), a new strategy is introduced where the [**process engine**](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/flowx-engine) sends messages to a Kafka topic whenever there is something to be indexed from a [**process instance**](../../docs/building-blocks/process/active-process/process-instance). [Kafka Connect](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect) is configured to read these messages and send them to ElasticSearch for indexing. This approach allows for fire-and-forget communication, eliminating the need for the process engine to wait for indexing requests to complete.

[Process instance indexing](https://docs.flowx.ai/docs/2.14.0/platform-setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/configuring-elasticsearch-indexing)

#### KafkaConnect ElasticSearch sink plugin

A new component, Kafka Connect with configuration, has been added. This component enables Kafka Connect to listen to a specific topic where process instances generate messages and send those messages to Elastic Search indexes. The configuration includes the utilization of a KafkaConnect ElasticSearch sink connector plugin, which is responsible for handling this task. The plugin is configured with a connector.

[Example configuration for applying the solution with Kafka Connect](https://docs.flowx.ai/docs/2.14.0/platform-setup-guides/flowx-engine-setup-guide/configuring-elasticsearch-indexing#example-configuration-for-applying-the-solution-with-kafka-connect)

#### New microservice: Advancing Controller

Advancing Controller holds the liquibase database scripts for the advancing PostgreSQL. It is also watching if a process-engine worker [pod](../../docs/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-kubernetes#node--pods) is down. 

When a pod is down, the service reassigns the work of that dead pod, to be picked up by other pods, avoiding [process instances](../../docs/building-blocks/process/active-process/process-instance) to be blocked in advancing.
