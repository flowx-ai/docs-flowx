#### Removed Form Group UI element

**Form Group** UI element is removed, all [**Form Groups**](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/root-components/form-group) elements will become [**Containers**](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/root-components/container).
  
[UI Designer](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer)

### Reporting plugin 

Added the possibility to create and bootstrap custom reports built on generic information about usage and processes using the new reporting plugin. 

You can create multiple reports to meet any need when it comes to business flows. It enables users to analyze data using datasets, and to easily build charts and dashboards.

#### Use in reporting flag

This flag is available inside **Data model** (for the keys that must be used in the reporting) and inside **Process settings** tab, to include a process definition in reporting.

### FLOWX.AI Engine üöÇ

#### New microservice: Advancing Controller

Advancing Controller holds the liquibase database scripts for the advancing PostgreSQL. It is also watching if a process-engine worker [pod](../../docs/platform-overview/frameworks-and-standards/event-driven-architecture-frameworks/intro-to-kubernetes#node--pods) is down. 

When a pod is down, the service reassigns the work of that dead pod, to be picked up by other pods, avoiding [process instances](../../docs/building-blocks/process/active-process/process-instance) to be blocked in advancing.
