# 🆕 v3.3.0 - May 2023

Drumroll please... 🥁 We are excited to announce **FLOWX.AI 3.3** release 🔥.

So, what are you waiting for? Grab a snack, sit back, and get ready to explore the newest version of **FLOWX.AI**.

## **New features** 🆕

### UI Designer ✍️

#### New slider UI element



## **Bug fixes** 🔧

## **Changed** 🛠️

### Data model

#### Display data model references

This update introduces the ability to view attribute usage within the process. You can now easily see where a specific attribute is being used by accessing the "View References" feature. This feature provides a list of process data keys associated with each attribute and displays possible references, such as UI Elements.

:::

#### Use in reporting

* You can now set "Used in reporting" and “Sensitive data” flags for an object or array of objects (all the child attributes will inherit its value - "true" or "false"), without the need to edit each attribute

#### Copy-paste objects

* Copy-paste objects structure under data model


## **Known issues** 🙁

### Reporting

* Reporting plugin is not compatible with Oracle DBs.

### UI Designer

* When configuring an [Input UI element](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/input-form-field) with a 'Has clear' (content clear) property, we recommend setting a fixed width value for the element. If the width is set to 'fill', it may cause the UI to break
