 Explore [<u>**Versioning**</u>](../../docs/building-blocks/process/versioning) for more details.


### Fresh nodes: Timer Events

Timer event nodes are a powerful feature in BPMN that allow you to introduce time-based behavior into your processes. These nodes enable you to trigger specific actions or events at predefined time intervals, durations, or cycles. With timer event nodes, you can design processes that respond to time-related conditions, ensuring smoother workflow execution and enhanced automation.

Three primary Timer Event node types:

* Timer Start Event (interrupting/non-interrupting)
* Timer Intermediate Event
* Timer Boundary Event (interrupting/non-interrupting)

So whether it's reminders, recurring tasks, or tasks with deadlines, these Timer Event nodes are your go-to for keeping things in sync with the clock.

### FLOWX.AI Designer 

#### Managing Fonts

Font Management allows you to upload and manage multiple font files, which can be later utilized when configuring UI templates using the UI Designer. Users can now upload multiple TTF font files, the system will identify additional data like font family, weight, and style for each file. That can be done using the new menu entry added under **Content Management > Font files**.

Get a grip on fonts like a pro. Now you can upload and handle multiple font files for your UI templates. TTF font files? Sure thing! The system even sorts out font family, weight, and style for each file. Just head to **Content Management > Font** files to check it out.

### UI Designer

#### Attributed strings for Markdown support

Added a new integration of styled text within specific UI components. Here's what you can expect:

* Markdown Support: a range of Markdown syntax using a markdown editor.

:::info
Supported tags in the current iteration: bold, italic, bold italic, strikethrough and URLs.

#### Example:

- **Bold** 

```markdown
**Bold**
```

- *italic*

```markdown
*italic*
```

- ***bold italic***

```markdown
***bold italic***
```
- strikethrough

```markdown
~~strikethrough~~
```
- URL

```markdown
[URL](https://url.net)
```

Let's take the following Markdown text example:

```markdown
Be among the *first* to receive updates about our **exciting new products** and releases. Subscribe [here](flowx.ai/newsletter) to stay in the loop! Do not ~~miss~~ it!
```
When running the process it will be displayed like this:

:::

* Enhanced UI Element Compatibility: The attributed strings feature has been integrated with essential UI elements such as text, switch, and indicators (messages). This ensures consistent rendering of Markdown within these components, enriching your users' experience.

## **Bug Fixes** üîß

## **Changed** üõ†Ô∏è

### Process Designer

#### Keyboard commands

#### Data model

* Revamped Object-Level Settings with Enhanced Attribute Flags.

### Other Bits

* Bid farewell to the autoarrange function in the [**Process Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer).

## **Gremlins to Watch Out For** üôÅ

* **Slider UI element**: Currently, there is an issue where the value thumb of a slider component does not display the correct value when sourced from process data.
* **Business rules**: Presently, there is an issue where changing the language of a [**business rule**](../../docs/terms/business-rules) does not result in its execution using the new language. Despite updating the language value in the database, the business rule continues to be executed with the original language, leading to unexpected behavior.
* **Process Designer**: 
    * In certain cases, deleting a boundary node in the process designer and navigating back to the [**process designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer) from the [**UI Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-ai-ui-designer) does not remove the associated sequence from the boundary event. This issue specifically occurs when the sequence is linked to the deleted boundary node.
    * Some select sequence buttons in the UI might have a mind of their own and overlap.
    * Selecting node names with a mouse click can be a bit temperamental.
* **Plugin Quirks**: The reporting plugin and Oracle DBs aren't exactly best buddies right now.
