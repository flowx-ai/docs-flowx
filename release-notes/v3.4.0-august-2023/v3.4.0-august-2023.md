### Fresh nodes: Timer Events

These nodes enable you to trigger specific actions or events at predefined time intervals, durations, or cycles. With timer event nodes, you can design processes that respond to time-related conditions, ensuring smoother workflow execution and enhanced automation.

Three primary Timer Event node types:

* [**Timer Start Event**](../../docs/building-blocks/node/timer-events/timer-start-event) (interrupting/non-interrupting)
* [**Timer Intermediate Event**](../../docs/building-blocks/node/timer-events/timer-intermediate-event)
* [**Timer Boundary Event**](../../docs/building-blocks/node/timer-events/timer-boundary-event) (interrupting/non-interrupting)

So whether it's reminders, recurring tasks, or tasks with deadlines, these Timer Event nodes are your go-to for keeping things in sync with the clock.

### FLOWX.AI Designer 

#### Font Management

Font Management allows you to upload and manage multiple font files, which can be later utilized when configuring UI templates using the UI Designer. You can now upload multiple TTF font files, the platform will identify additional data like font family, weight, and style for each file. That can be done using the new menu entry added under **Content Management > Font files**.

### UI Designer

#### Attributed strings for Markdown support

Enhance the design of UI components with the new Markdown support, including features such as bold, italic, strikethrough, and clickable URLs. This feature integrates with the following UI components: text, [switch](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/form-elements/switch-form-field), and [message indicators](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/indicators), ensuring a consistent and polished rendering experience.

## **Bug Fixes** üîß

## **Changed** üõ†Ô∏è

### Process Designer

#### Keyboard commands

* To edit a selected node label, press "R," which puts the label in edit mode. After editing, press "Enter" to save the new name.
* To copy selected nodes, use "CMD/Ctrl + C," and to paste them into a selected swimlane, use "CMD/Ctrl + V."
* To delete selected node(s), press "Backspace."

#### Data model

* Revamped Object-Level Settings with Enhanced Attribute Flags.

### Other Bits

* Bid farewell to the autoarrange function in the [**Process Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer).

## **Gremlins to Watch Out For** üôÅ

* **Slider UI element**: Currently, there is an issue where the value thumb of a slider component does not display the correct value when sourced from process data.
* **Business rules**: Presently, there is an issue where changing the language of a [**business rule**](../../docs/terms/business-rules) does not result in its execution using the new language. Despite updating the language value in the database, the business rule continues to be executed with the original language, leading to unexpected behavior.
* **Process Designer**: 
    * In certain cases, deleting a boundary node in the process designer and navigating back to the [**process designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer) from the [**UI Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-ai-ui-designer) does not remove the associated sequence from the boundary event. This issue specifically occurs when the sequence is linked to the deleted boundary node.
    * Some select sequence buttons in the UI might have a mind of their own and overlap.
* **Plugin Quirks**: The reporting plugin and Oracle DBs aren't exactly best buddies right now.
