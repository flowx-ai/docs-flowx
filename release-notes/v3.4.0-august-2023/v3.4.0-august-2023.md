### FLOWX.AI Designer 

#### Fonts management

Font management allows you to upload and manage multiple font files, which can be later utilized when configuring UI templates using the UI Designer. Users can now upload multiple TTF font files, the system will identify additional data like font family, weight, and style for each file. That can be done using the new menu entry added under **Content Management > Font files**.

## **Bug Fixes** üîß

## **Changed** üõ†Ô∏è

### Process Designer

#### Keyboard commands

#### Data model


### Other

* The autoarrange function has been removed from [**Process Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer).

## **Known issues** üôÅ

* **Slider UI element**: Currently, there is an issue where the value thumb of a slider component does not display the correct value when sourced from process data.
* **Business rules**: Presently, there is an issue where changing the language of a [**business rule**](../../docs/terms/business-rules) does not result in its execution using the new language. Despite updating the language value in the database, the business rule continues to be executed with the original language, leading to unexpected behavior.
* **Process Designer**: 
    * In certain cases, deleting a boundary node in the process designer and navigating back to the [**process designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer) from the [**UI Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-ai-ui-designer) does not remove the associated sequence from the boundary event. This issue specifically occurs when the sequence is linked to the deleted boundary node.
    * Select Sequence buttons in the nodes UI interface may overlap.
    * There is a known issue where users are unable to select the node name with the mouse in the user interface.
* **Plugins**: Reporting plugin is not compatible with Oracle DBs.
