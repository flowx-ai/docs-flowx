# v2.13.0 - October 2022

Howdy:wave:. Did you miss us? Here is what we prepared for you on our latest release:

## **New features**

### Core extensions

#### Audit log üîé

New audit log component added. The new service is essentially a record of events and changes. The new audit microservice enables the user to have all the events/changes grouped in a dedicated section inside the Designer web app.

:::info
Audit log is also available at granular level, for example, you can also find an audit log at **Active Process** > **Process instance**.

### CMS Core üìö

#### Media library  

A new media library component was added under the **Content management** tab in the Designer app. This is a new place where all the media assets used in the processes are centralized.

#### Copy / Paste UI Elements

[UI Elements](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types) configured using the [UI Designer](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer) can now be copied and pasted across the editor canvas (they must be compatible with the element in which they are pasted).

#### New Source Location - Media Library

When configuring an **Image** on a process using the UI Designer, you have now the possibility to add one from a new **Source Location** -> **Media Library**.

There are two options available:

* to select an image from Media Library
* to upload an image to Media Library on the spot
