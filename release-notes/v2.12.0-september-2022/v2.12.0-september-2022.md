# üÜï  v2.12.0 - September 2022

Howdy:wave:. Did you miss us? Here is what we prepared for you on our latest release:

## **New features**

### üïµÔ∏è Search for data in another process

The new search data microservice enables you to search/look for data (using Kafka Send/ Kafka receive actions) in another processes. Using elastic search the service will be able to search for keys that are indexed there via existing mechanics.

### :pencil2: UI Designer

#### FormGroup UI Element should have no styling

To improve the mobile user experience, a new component identifier "CARD" was added, with FLOWX props title and subtitle. The new card element can be added as root component in a user task.

#### Add node actions from UI Designer

Now is possible to create and add node actions directly from UI Designer, without having to go back and forth between UI and process config while designing a page that contains actions.

#### Prefill UI action name with node action name

The default value for UI action name field is prefilled with the node action name, unless the user chooses to change it.

#### Display warning when a node is being edited by another user

When a node inside a process definition is being edited by a user and another user opens this process definition, avatar icons of both users are being displayed. Hovering over the avatar will display the full name of the user.
