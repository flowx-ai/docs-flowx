# v2.5.0 - April 2022

## **New features**

ðŸ—ƒ  **Copy / Paste nodes** - It is now possible to copy a group of nodes & paste that copied group of nodes in the same process definition or in another process definition inside FLOWX Designer.

To perform a **copy** action, do the following:

1. Select multiple BPMN nodes - use **CMD/Ctrl + Click**. The nodes you select will be highlighted as you can see in the picture below.

2. Trigger the copy action - using the **contextual menu** (right-click menu).&#x20;

:::info
The result (**success** or **error**) is presented with a notification when the request ends. **Success**: _"Nodes copied successfully."_  **Error**: _"There was an error copying the nodes."_
:::

To trigger a **paste** action, access the **contextual menu**. The pasted nodes are displayed with a `duplicated_ID` label.
