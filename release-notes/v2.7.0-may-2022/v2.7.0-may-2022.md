# v2.7.0 - May 2022

## **New Features**

### :writing_hand: FLOWX Designer - Access Management

You can now use Access Management to administrate users, roles and groups, directly in FLOWX Designer. Access Management helps you to access the identity management solution (keycloak/[RH-SSO](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on)) through its API, extracting all the necessary details. Access Management is based on user roles that need to be configured in the identity management solution.

:::danger
The access rights-related configuration needs to be set up for each microservice. Default options are preconfigured. They can be overwritten using environment variables.

### :writing_hand: FLOWX Designer - Swimlane Drag Handle

You can now move a swimlane individually (instead of moving the whole process canvas) to easily navigate through the process and arrange swimlanes.
