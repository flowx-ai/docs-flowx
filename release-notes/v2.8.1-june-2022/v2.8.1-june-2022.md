# v2.8.1 - June 2022

Howdy:wave:. Here is what we prepared for you on our latest release:

## **New features**

### üë©‚Äçüè≠ ‚ÄãFLOWX.AI Admin <a href="#flowx-admin" id="flowx-admin"></a>

#### Import BPMN <a href="#import-export-bpmn-2.0" id="import-export-bpmn-2.0"></a>

Import BPMN is a feature that helps you edit/create a process starting from an already designed BPMN diagram. You can now import a BPMN process  (**.bpmn** extension) in [FLOWX Designer](../../docs/flowx-designer).

:::caution
**NOTE:** Imported processes do not contain [actions](../../docs/building-blocks/actions). You must define and add actions to the process after the import.

* fixed an issue where token reset values with copy keys would copy the keys as flatten
