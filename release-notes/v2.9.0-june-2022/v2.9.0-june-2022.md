Howdy:wave:. Here is what we prepared for you on our latest release:

## **New features**

### :writing_hand: FLOWX.AI Designer <a href="#flowx-admin" id="flowx-admin"></a>

#### Process Designer

* **Drop node on sequence** - you can now easily add a new node between two existing nodes connected with a sequence, see the example below

* **Rename node on Process Designer** - you can now rename a node added in the Process Designer canvas without opening the Node config panel, by just using the **Edit name** feature (when selecting a node)

## **Changed**

### :steam_locomotive: FLOWX.AI Engine
