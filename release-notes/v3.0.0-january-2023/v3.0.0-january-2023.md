We are excited to announce the release of FLOWX.AI 3.0 üî•, featuring new and improved features that will elevate your workflow experience. From the new theming options to enhanced functionality, this update will take your productivity to the next level. üöÄ 

## **New features**

### Theming

FLOWX.AI 3.0 introduces a new theming feature, allowing users to control and customize all the components to their personal preferences: both on web or mobile. The new theming feature provides an improved user experience and allows for greater flexibility in how the platform is used.

Generic JSONs for components were added.

### UI Designer ‚úèÔ∏è

#### UI Components redesign

[UI components](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types)

## **Fixed**

* **[DESIGNER]** - a bug where the datepicker component default value overlapped with the field placeholder has been fixed
* **[DESIGNER]** - an issue where users couldn't copy/paste nodes that have UI actions without parameters has been fixed
* **[NOTIFICATIONS_PLUGIN]** - Forwarding external notifications is now possible.
* **[CMS]** - an issue where GET enumerations list displayed an error message about memory exceeding has been fixed


## **Changed**

### Documents plugin

* Updated document plugin file download path to use file UUID (string) instead of a numeric file ID

#### Audit log 

* Now `name` is displayed instead of `identifiers` for process definition, node, action, swimlanes entities

[Audit log](../../docs/platform-deep-dive/core-components/core-extensions/audit)

#### Sensitive data

* Removed Sensitive data tab from process definition settings and added a new Sensitive data switch in the Data model tab
* Sensitive data migration - sensitive data in published processes remains the same (when cloning, sensitive data is deleted as it is not compatible with the new version). You must add the data model and keys for the sensitive data yourself

[Data model](../../docs/building-blocks/process/process-definition#data-model)

#### Platform status report

* `Ctrl/Cmd + C` - copy one or several selected nodes
* `R` - rename a node

#### Kafka

* standardized Kafka topics & naming pattern: configuration only for package name, env name and version, no need for listing all topic names - minimize confusion and errors

### Data search

* elasticSearch index in which data search looks can be configurable

## Security
