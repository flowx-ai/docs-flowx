# v2.4.0-March 2022

## **New features**

:checkered_flag: **Granular access control in the Designer app** - It is now possible to set up granular access to different platform components in the Designer app. This is useful for hiding / showing different menu items and allowed actions for each user. These are based on user roles that need to be configured in the identity management solution.

:::caution
The access rights related configuration needs to be set up for each microservice. Default options are preconfigured. They can be overwritten using environment variables.
:::

:::danger
Without the correct configuration and explicitly providing the correct access scopes, a user who previously had access to Designer features will lose all access. Please check the deployment guidelines!
:::

:repeat: **Collections** - With this feature, you can configure a repeatable piece of the user interface. By setting the collectionâ€™s source as any data list from your process you can display a custom user interface of each element of your list.

![Employees Collection Example](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/release-notes/240collections.png)

The repeatable user interface is controlled by a repetitive template (collection prototype) in the UI Designer where with no code/full code approach you can achieve complex UI configuration.

You can find more details about how to configure a collection [here](../../docs/building-blocks/ui-designer/ui-component-types/collection).
