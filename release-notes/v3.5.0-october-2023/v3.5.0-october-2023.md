# v3.5.0-October 2023

We are thrilled to unveil FlowX Version **3.5.0,** the latest milestone in our journey to enhance your workflow and boost productivity. 

This release marks a significant step forward, bringing a host of new features and improvements designed to make your experience with FlowX even smoother and more efficient. 

## **What's new** üÜï

### Navigation areas (removed Milestones nodes) 

In this release, we've bid farewell to **Milestone Nodes**, ushering in a fresh and improved approach to organizing the user interface. Say hello to a sleeker and more efficient system with the introduction of [**Navigation areas**](../../docs/building-blocks/process/navigation-areas).

### Error Events

### Versioning - My Favorites

### Nodes redesign


## **Bug Fixes** üîß


* Addressed various bugs from previous versions to enhance stability and reliability.


### Other Bits

* We've bid farewell to the autoarrange function in the [**Process Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer).

## **Gremlins to Watch Out For** üôÅ

Keep an eye out for these quirks:

* **Slider UI element**: Our slider component can be a bit mysterious at times. Currently, it enjoys a game of hide-and-seek with the correct value when sourced from process data.
* **Document preview UI element**: Our document preview component has a unique sense of style. It prefers to take up only a portion of the screen, even when told to "fill" the entire width. It's a rebel with a cause.
* **Business rules**: Our business rule have a language barrier, but they're working on it. Changing the language of a business rule doesn't always lead to using the new language for execution. It's like they have a favorite phrase they won't let go of.
* **Process Designer**: Deleting a boundary node in the process designer and coming back from the UI Designer doesn't always clean up the associated sequence from the boundary event. It's like they left a party and forgot their hat.
* **Datepicker Date Transformation**: Our Datepicker seems to possess a hidden talent. It mysteriously transforms random text into the current date when used with validators in UI Designer.
* **Text Element Issue**: Our text element tends to vanish when set to "0" or "-". Expected it to show up, but it's playing hide-and-seek instead!
