This release marks a significant step forward, bringing a host of new features and improvements designed to make your experience with FlowX even smoother and more efficient. 

## **What's new** üÜï

### Navigation areas (removed Milestones nodes) 

In this release, we've bid farewell to **Milestone Nodes** ![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/3.5/start-milestone.png) ![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/3.5/end-milestone.png), ushering in a fresh and improved approach to organizing the user interface. Say hello to a sleeker and more efficient system with the introduction of [**Navigation areas**](../../docs/building-blocks/process/navigation-areas).

### Error Events - Error Intermediate boundary event

We are excited to introduce a new type of node in BPMN 2.0, specifically Error Events: Error Intermediate boundary event, which expand the capabilities of process modeling and error handling within your BPMN diagrams.

These Error Event nodes enhance the BPMN standard and offer improved control over error management.

### Nodes redesign

### Favorites tab

In this release, we added a new feature that allows users to mark processes as favorites. This enhancement provides users with a convenient way to identify and prioritize processes that are important to them, streamlining their workflow. With the addition of the favorite process feature, we have included a dedicated tab within the process definition list.

## **Changed** üõ†Ô∏è

### Remove timeout from node

### Manually reposition sequences

## **Bug Fixes** üîß


* Addressed various bugs from previous versions to enhance stability and reliability.


### Other Bits

* We've bid farewell to the autoarrange function in the [**Process Designer**](../../docs/terms/flowx-process-designer).

## **Gremlins to Watch Out For** ![](https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/docx.flowx.ai/3.5/gremlin_final.png)

Keep an eye out for these quirks:

* **Slider UI element**: Our slider component can be a bit mysterious at times. Currently, it enjoys a game of hide-and-seek with the correct value when sourced from process data.
* **Document preview UI element**: Our document preview component has a unique sense of style. It prefers to take up only a portion of the screen, even when told to "fill" the entire width. It's a rebel with a cause.
* **Business rules**: Our business rule have a language barrier, but they're working on it. Changing the language of a business rule doesn't always lead to using the new language for execution. It's like they have a favorite phrase they won't let go of.
* **Process Designer**: Deleting a boundary node in the process designer and coming back from the UI Designer doesn't always clean up the associated sequence from the boundary event. It's like they left a party and forgot their hat.
* **Datepicker Date Transformation**: Our Datepicker seems to possess a hidden talent. It mysteriously transforms random text into the current date when used with validators in UI Designer.
* **Text Element Issue**: Our text element tends to vanish when set to "0" or "-". Expected it to show up, but it's playing hide-and-seek instead!
