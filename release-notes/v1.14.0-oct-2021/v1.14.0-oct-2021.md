# v1.14.0 - Oct 2021

## **New features**

:notebook_with_decorative_cover: **Dynamic dropdowns**: Added the ability to use process data as content source for SELECT, CHECKBOX and RADIO form fields. In the designer there is now a new option for data source for dropdown fields: `Process Data`.

**New action type**: `Save data`: To easily mark actions for saving form data.

**New UI Action type**: `Dismiss process`: This can be used on buttons for cancelling / closing subprocesses.

## **Fixed**

### Engine

* Fixed an issue where the process data wasn't requested for all template IDs in the template sequence when refreshing a subprocess configured with a stepper

### Designer

* Fixed an issue where, when configuring an IMAGE UI element, the process data input key wasn't available
* Fixed an issue where the `keysForRestart` value wasn't used when configuring back in steps. This key is used to copy/remove key from current state of the process instance objects

## **Changed**

* Updated the amount of data saved in the engine logs
* Added new environment variable for authorization related logs: `LOGGING_OAUTH2_EXC_LOGLEVEL`
